For a long time I've been meaning to blog about the fascinating occupation of building software and getting customers to sign up and use them. I registered my name OumarWone.com as my domain all the way back in 2005 with the intention of building it into a site that would chronicle my professional life and serve as an outlet to write about my huge interest in technology in general. 

For some reason I never got around to launching the site. The motivation was always there but there was always something on the way, too much work to maintain a blog or that once launched the content would go stale from the lack of frequent updates. 

Now almost ten years later, the site is finally live! Why now you'd ask? Well, the urge to put down my thoughts in writing just keeps getting stronger. To the point where I can't ignore or delay it anymore. 

I'm looking forward to writing about topics covering the technical issues web & mobile developers wrestle with daily. This blog will also allow me to scratch my marketing itch or should I say the art and science of getting people to use an app be it web based or mobile. I'll be sharing my thoughts on [Growth Hacking], a subject I'm greatly interested in. I believe all entrepreneurs, programmers and marketers should familiarize themselves with this highly effective approach to customer acquisition and retention.

I realized that maintaining a blog will not negatively impact my professional or personal schedule. Just like everything else in life it just takes good organization and discipline.
Another motivator albeit at a much lesser extent is the tool I'm using to generate my blog. [Jekyll] is an awesome blog aware static website generator. It immediately appealed to me and I had to give it a try. In addition it's an open source program written in [Ruby], a language I'm deeply immersed in currently. Ruby is a joy to work with, give it a try if you haven't already. Oh and a final deciding factor is the fact that I can host my site (for free) on [Github Pages] how's that for blogging like a geek!

So as the saying goes: better late than never. I hope the site will be of use to somebody out there.
