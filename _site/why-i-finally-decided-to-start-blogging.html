          <h2>Why I Finally Decided To Start Blogging</h2>
<p class="meta">29 Mar 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>For a long time I&#39;ve been meaning to blog about the fascinating occupation of building software and getting customers to sign up and use them. I registered my name OumarWone.com as my domain all the way back in 2005 with the intention of building it into a site that would chronicle my professional life and serve as an outlet to write about my huge interest in technology in general. </p>

<p>For some reason I never got around to launching the site. The motivation was always there but there was always something on the way, too much work to maintain a blog or that once launched the content would go stale from the lack of frequent updates. </p>

<p>Now almost ten years later, the site is finally live! Why now you&#39;d ask? Well, the urge to put down my thoughts in writing just keeps getting stronger. To the point where I can&#39;t ignore or delay it anymore. </p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to writing about topics covering the technical issues web &amp; mobile developers wrestle with daily. This blog will also allow me to scratch my marketing itch or should I say the art and science of getting people to use an app be it web based or mobile. I&#39;ll be sharing my thoughts on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hacking">Growth Hacking</a>, a subject I&#39;m greatly interested in. I believe all entrepreneurs, programmers and marketers should familiarize themselves with this highly effective approach to customer acquisition and retention.</p>

<p>I realized that maintaining a blog will not negatively impact my professional or personal schedule. Just like everything else in life it just takes good organization and discipline.
Another motivator albeit at a much lesser extent is the tool I&#39;m using to generate my blog. <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is an awesome blog aware static website generator. It immediately appealed to me and I had to give it a try. In addition it&#39;s an open source program written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, a language I&#39;m deeply immersed in currently. Ruby is a joy to work with, give it a try if you haven&#39;t already. Oh and a final deciding factor is the fact that I can host my site (for free) on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> how&#39;s that for blogging like a geek!</p>

<p>So as the saying goes: better late than never. I hope the site will be of use to somebody out there.</p>
